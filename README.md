ðŸ“Š Data Analysis with Pandas & Matplotlib

ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The objective of this assignment is to:

Load and explore a dataset using pandas.

Perform basic data analysis (statistics & grouping).

Visualize data using matplotlib and seaborn.

Share findings and insights from the dataset.

ðŸ“‚ Tasks

Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset

Chose the Iris dataset (a classic dataset for classification problems).

Loaded dataset using pandas and seaborn.

Displayed first few rows using .head().

Explored structure with .info() and checked for missing values.

Cleaned dataset by dropping missing values if any.


Task 2: Basic Data Analysis

Computed descriptive statistics with .describe().

Grouped data by species and calculated mean of numerical columns.

Identified interesting patterns, such as differences in petal/sepal lengths among species.


Task 3: Data Visualization

Created four different visualizations:

1. Line Chart â€“ Cumulative petal length over samples.


2. Bar Chart â€“ Average petal length per species.


3. Histogram â€“ Distribution of sepal length.


4. Scatter Plot â€“ Relationship between sepal length and petal length (colored by species).



All plots were customized with titles, axis labels, and legends.

ðŸ“Š Key Findings

Setosa has much smaller petals compared to Versicolor and Virginica.

Virginica shows the largest average petal length.

The scatter plot shows clear separation of Setosa, which makes it easy to classify.

Sepal length distribution is fairly normal, with variation across species.
